## Hello thereðŸ‘‹
Just a few facts about me, my interests and projects:)

## My Scientific Arsenal:-
a) Bioinformatics led omics data analysis for predictive modeling of data ðŸ“š

b) AI/ML driven biomedical applications and advancements in quantum-cryoEm applications in biology ðŸ’»

c) Drug-enzyme testing and biomarkers identification for targeted patient specific drug response ðŸ’Š

d) Cancer oncology and immunotherapy ðŸ§¬

e) Disease pathology and pathway integrated studies :)

Also like tinkering with bioprocess and microbial mutagenesis :) ðŸ¥¼
