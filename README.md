## Hello thereğŸ‘‹
Just a few facts about me, my interests and projects <!--
**Ani-0506/Ani-0506** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

## My Scientific Arsenal:-
a) Bioinformatics led omics data analysis for predictive modeling of data ğŸ“š

b) AI/ML driven biomedical applications and advancements in quantum-cryoEm applications in biology ğŸ’»

c) Drug-enzyme testing and biomarkers identification for targeted patient specific drug response ğŸ’Š

d) Cancer oncology and immunotherapy ğŸ§¬

e) Disease pathology and pathway integrated studies :)

Also like tinkering with bioprocess and microbial mutagenesis :) ğŸ¥¼
